## About
> "JavaScript, often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time (JIT) compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions."
