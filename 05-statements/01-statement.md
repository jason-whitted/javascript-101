# Statement

A statement is a single commanding task followed by a semicolon.


```js
var fullName;

var first = "John";
var last = "Smith";

fullName = first + " " + last;
```

The above code consists of 4 statements:
- Declare `fullName`
- Declare `first` and initialize to "Joe"
- Declare `last` and initialize to "Smith"
- Assign `fullName` to a concatenated value.

## Aside
JavaScript has "automatic semicolon insertion".  In most cases the compiler will process your code correctly without semicolons.

The modern JavaScript community is not on agreement on semicolon usage.

## Conventions
While learning JavaScript, it is important to understand statements; therefore, I would recommend you treat semicolons as required.
