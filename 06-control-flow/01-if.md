# Control Flow: If

The `if` statement executes a statement only if a condition is truthy.

## Syntax
To conditionally execute a single statement:
```js
if (condition) statement1;
```

To conditionally execute a block of zero or more statements:
```js
if (condition) {
  statement1;
  statement2;
}
```

## Conventions
While at first it may seem more convenient to forgo the wavy braces, you will find yourself spending more time adding/deleting these braces over time as your code changes.

Your code will be more consistent and easier to maintain if you always use the wavy brace syntax.

```js
// Prefer this:
if (valid) {
  fullName = first + " " + last;
}

// Not this:
if (valid) fullName = first + " " + last;
```

Additionally, in JavaScript the standard for wavy braces is to start your block on the preceding line.
```js
// Prefer this:
if (condition) {
  statement;
}

// Not this:
if (condition)
{
  statement;
}
```

Finally, when your condition is comparing booleans it is redundant/unnecessary to do equality checks against boolean literals.
```js
// Prefer this:
if (enabled && !required) {
  statement;
}

// Not this:
if (enabled === true && required === false) {
  statement;
}
```
